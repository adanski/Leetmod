A Call of Duty 4 mod by nostalgicamigo based on
[OpenWarfare (archived)](http://web.archive.org/web/20111128184124/http://openwarfaremod.com/owforum/viewtopic.php?f=59&t=3076).

This is a fork of [nostalgicamigo's original repository](http://sourceforge.net/projects/leetmod/) for archiving purposes.

## Description

Leetmod brings many new features and fixes upon CoD4 v1.7.
Everything that was wrong, unbalanced or missing was improved.
Also brings bots to the game (powered by PeZBOT).

It was born from the necessity of balancing the game and players and at the same time be an autonomous and dynamic tool
that controls the rotation, gameplay and more.

We like to think in Leetmod as a Call of Duty 4 v1.8 (which was never released), seeing that, everything that was wrong,
unbalanced or missing, was improved, just like a patch.

See also the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md).

### In-Game Menu: Create-a-Class

Creating, saving and using a class is even faster than before, thanks to the quick selections and keyboard support.
Also, you don't have to wait to unlock anything, you can manually unlock each item you need if you want.

### In-Game Menu: End-of-Game Statistics

At the end of game, many statistics are presented with the best players on that category too.
Finally, you can see who was the biggest camper.

### In-Game Menu: Admin Control Panel

Now you can control maps, rotation, rules, and players on your server in-game.
Very useful for server admins and also in LAN Parties because you can quickly switch anything.
